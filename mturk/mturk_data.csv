I also don't see why you couldn't just replace the batteries with working ones or leave them plugged in; and use them as MP3 players.  You cold toss a few into Christmas presents to make noise when they're shaken; so the person can't tell what they're getting. You could take them apart to learn how they work; or to harvest the parts (wires; electronics; displays if they're there; etc.) You can use them like flash drives in a pinch -- after all; they have a USB connection and storage space. You could take all the inside stuff out and use the shell as a box for small items. Maybe it would be a good place to hide jewelry or something; to hide it from thieves. That would depend on the original MP3 player; though. It would have to be a cheap one. I wouldn't use an iPod for that because people would want to steal it just as much as they would jewelry. Maybe you could take out the speakers and attach them to a laptop somehow; to make it louder? , 2014-06-20 17:08:37.781000, 2014-06-20 16:59:16.872000, 0:09:20.909000,
